Shared dependencies between the files:

1. AWS Resources: The AWS resources such as the DynamoDB table and the API Gateway are shared across all the stacks. These resources are defined in the base-stack/template.yaml and are used in the lambda-stack/template.yaml files.

2. Stack Parameters: The parameters for the stacks are defined in the base-stack/parameters.json and are used in the lambda-stack/parameters.json files. These parameters include the names and configurations of the AWS resources.

3. Deployment Scripts: The PowerShell scripts for deploying the stacks are shared across all the stacks. These scripts are located in the base-stack/powershell-scripts and lambda-stack/powershell-scripts directories.

4. ASP.NET Startup and Program Files: The Startup.cs and Program.cs files are shared across all the lambda stacks. These files contain the configuration and initialization code for the ASP.NET applications.

5. Logical Resource Ids: The Logical Resource Ids such as "MyApiGateway" and "MyDynamoDBTable" are shared across the CloudFormation templates and the deployment scripts.

6. Error Messages: The error messages such as "The REST API doesn't contain any methods" are shared across the deployment scripts and the CloudFormation templates.

7. Function Names: The function names in the PowerShell scripts and the ASP.NET files are shared across all the stacks. These function names include the names of the AWS SDK methods and the ASP.NET middleware methods.
