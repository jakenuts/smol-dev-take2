Shared dependencies across the files:

1. AWS.Tools.Common: This is the PowerShell module that is imported in all the PowerShell scripts for deploying the stacks. It provides the necessary AWS cmdlets for interacting with AWS services.

2. Stack Names: The names of the CloudFormation stacks (base-stack, lambda-stack1, lambda-stack2, lambda-stack3) are shared across the PowerShell scripts and their corresponding YAML templates. The scripts use these names to deploy the stacks, and the templates use these names to define the resources.

3. AWS Resource Names: The names of the shared AWS resources (MyApiGateway, MyDynamoDBTable) are used in the base stack template and in the lambda stack templates. These resources are created in the base stack and referenced in the lambda stacks.

4. AWS Resource Types: The types of the AWS resources (AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi, AWS::DynamoDB::Table, AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment, AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) are used in all the YAML templates to define the resources.

5. Error Messages: The error messages are shared across the PowerShell scripts. They are used to display information about any errors that occur during the deployment of the stacks.

6. PowerShell Cmdlets: The PowerShell cmdlets (Write-Host, Import-Module) are used in all the PowerShell scripts. They are used to display information and to import the necessary modules.

7. Deployment Steps: The steps for deploying the stacks are shared across the README file and the PowerShell scripts. The scripts perform the steps, and the README file describes them.
