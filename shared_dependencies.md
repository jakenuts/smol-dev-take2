Shared dependencies across the files:

1. AWS Resources: The AWS resources such as the DynamoDB table (`MyDynamoDBTable`) and the API Gateway (`MyApiGateway`) are shared across the base stack and the lambda stacks. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` files and are used in the `deploy.ps1` PowerShell scripts.

2. Stack Names: The names of the CloudFormation stacks (`samplestack`, `lambda-stack-1`, `lambda-stack-2`) are shared across the `template.yaml`, `parameters.json`, and `deploy.ps1` files.

3. Parameters: The parameters for the AWS resources are shared across the `template.yaml`, `parameters.json`, and `deploy.ps1` files. These parameters include the names of the AWS resources and any configuration options for those resources.

4. Deployment Scripts: The PowerShell deployment scripts (`deploy-base-stack.ps1`, `deploy-lambda-stack-1.ps1`, `deploy-lambda-stack-2.ps1`) are shared across the base stack and the lambda stacks. These scripts use the AWS resources and parameters to deploy the stacks.

5. ASP.NET Application Code: The ASP.NET application code in the `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs` files is shared across the lambda stacks. This code defines the behavior of the lambda functions and uses the AWS resources.

6. README: The README file references all of the above elements, providing instructions on how to deploy the stacks using the PowerShell scripts.
