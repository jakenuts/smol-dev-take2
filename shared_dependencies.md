The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. AWS Resources: These are shared across the YAML and JSON files. They include the AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi (MyApiGateway), AWS::DynamoDB::Table (MyDynamoDBTable), and AWS::CloudFormation::Stack (samplestack).

2. PowerShell Modules: The PowerShell scripts share the AWS.Tools.Common module, which is imported for AWS operations.

3. PowerShell Functions: The PowerShell scripts share the "sam deploy" command and the error handling function Write-Host "Failed to deploy stack $stackName : $($_.Exception.Message)".

4. JSON Parameters: The JSON files share the same structure for defining parameters for the AWS resources.

5. YAML Templates: The YAML files share the same structure for defining AWS resources and their properties.

6. Stack Names: The stack names (base-stack, lambda-stack-1, lambda-stack-2) are shared across the PowerShell scripts and the corresponding YAML and JSON files.

7. README.md: This file references all other files and their deployment steps, making it dependent on the names and structures of all other files.
